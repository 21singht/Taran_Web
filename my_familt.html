 <p>	My mother is the cook/kid care taker/Worker. She is the ultimate super Mom. She will do anything just to please me and keep me entertained while taking care of the house.				  
 <p> My father the worker and lamp of the family. He can fix literally anything a tv, bed and exct. He has his own company called Swatch Fuel Transport.					  
 <p> My brother, the biggest blackmailing, hypocritical, spoiled person in existence by all I’ve said you can see how much I love him.
 <p>My grandma is someone who is always smiling no matter the circumstances she is someone I can go to in a time of need and I take care of her as much as she does me.
