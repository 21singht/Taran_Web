                       <p>Soccer is my favorite sport. I play soccer everytime the weather seems good outside there is not one day where I don't juggle, dribble, or shoot a soccer ball. I don't just like playing it, but I also like watching it. My favorite team is Arsenal and my favorite player is Neymar jr. His dribbling and the way he moves and lifts the ball is amazing, his nationality is brazilian.
					   <p>Video games are something that can be found in anybody's house, computer, or phone. Video games are something that most of our youth and adualts play. I have many different kinds of video games games like Infamous second son, fortnite, and assasins creed 4. Video games aren't just for playing by yourself there about playing with your friends and family. There are 4 kinds of consoles or gaming equipment most people use playstaion,xbox,nintendo, and pc. I either prefer playstation or pc.
					   <p> Drawing is something I do when im bored something I do to clear my mind. I usually draw cartoons or people. I can't just draw something whenever i feel like it I need inspiration. So I go online and draw. I also took art 1 this year which was amazing and fun.
